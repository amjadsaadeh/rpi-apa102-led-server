# rpi-apa102-led-server

This project is a simple server to control the leds of the [ReSpeaker 2-Mics Pi HAT](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/ReSpeaker_2_Mics_Pi_HAT/) via a REST API.
It's basically a wrapper around the [apa102-pi package](https://github.com/tinue/apa102-pi/tree/main/apa102_pi) and is inspired by the [example script](https://github.com/respeaker/mic_hat/blob/master/interfaces/pixels.py) provided by ReSpeaker.
